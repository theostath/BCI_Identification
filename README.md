# BCI_Identification
Biometric identification using BCI systems

This is a repository about my undergraduate thesis (University of Patras, Electrical and Computer Engineering).

You can find the pdf of the thesis here: https://nemertes.lis.upatras.gr/jspui/handle/10889/14472

## Data
To download the data, go here: https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/

You want the data from every subject (S001-S109), and the first two runs (R01 = baseline run eyes open and R02 = baseline run eyes closed).

Once the zip file is downloaded, you unzip it and put these files (only .edf, not .edf.event) in the same directory as the code, so you can read them properly.
